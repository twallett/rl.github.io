    "text": "Course Description\nThe aim of this course is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the reinforcement learning framework. The course will explore the key distinctions between reinforcement learning and other artificial intelligence learning paradigms, delve into relevant industry applications, and examine both classical and deep learning approaches. Additionally, the course will cover the taxonomy of reinforcement learning and offer hands-on experience through practical implementations using OpenAI Gymnasium and other learning environments.\nThe classical approach will focus on learning methods designed to find optimal solutions in tabular environments, whereas the deep learning approach will tackle the challenge of finding approximate optimal solutions in large or continuous environments through the use of deep learning architectures.\nThe course will introduce the taxonomy of reinforcement learning by focusing on model-free value-based methods, transitioning to value function approximation and deep learning approaches, followed by novel policy-based methods using state-of-the-art architectures to tackle complex environments.\nTo conclude, a discussion on advanced topics, applications, and outlook of reinforcement learning will be provided.",
