## Exploring vs. Exploiting

- We are **exploring** when we randomly select an action.  
  
  **Intuition:** _Acting randomly._

- We are **exploiting** when an action is selected based on its expected value. When we act this way, we are said to be acting in a _greedy_ manner.
  
  **Intuition:** _Acting systematically._

## Conflict of Exploring vs. Exploiting

- **Exploring all of the time** does not permit you to exploit your knowledge of expected values.

  **Question:** How do you maximize your expected value if you randomly pull bandit levers?

- **Exploiting all of the time** does not permit you to explore all of the options.

  **Question:** How do you know which bandit has the highest expected value if you only pull one bandit's lever?

- Thus, our decision-making must encompass a balance of exploring and exploiting actions.

## The Role of Epsilon

- Epsilon ($\epsilon$) is a fixed proportion that decides whether we explore or exploit our actions.

  \[
  A_t \gets 
  \begin{cases}
      \text{a random action with probability } \epsilon \\
      \arg\max_a Q(a) \text{ with probability } 1 - \epsilon
  \end{cases}
  \]

- Hence, **Epsilon Greedy** is an algorithm that allows us to balance our decision-making in this simple manner.
