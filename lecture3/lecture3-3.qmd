## Upper Confidence Boundaries

- **Upper Confidence Boundaries** allow us to select among the non-greedy actions according to their potential for actually being optimal.

  \[
  A_t \gets \arg\max_a \left[ Q(a) + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln(t)}{N(a)}} \right]
  \]

  **Where:**
  - $\sqrt{\frac{2 \ln(t)}{N(a)}}$ is the measure of variance of the action $a$.
  - The natural logarithm increases get smaller over time but are unbounded, so all actions will be selected.

## UCB Exploring vs. Exploiting

- Each time $a$ is selected, the uncertainty is presumably reduced: $N(a)$ increments, and as it appears in the denominator, the uncertainty term decreases.

  \[
  VAR \downarrow = \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln(t)}{N(a)\uparrow}}
  \]

- Each time an action other than $a$ is selected, $t$ increases but $N(a)$ does not; because $t$ appears in the numerator, the uncertainty estimate increases.

  \[
  VAR \uparrow = \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln(t) \uparrow}{N(a)}}
  \]
