Welcome to DATS 6450: Reinforcement Learning! ðŸš€ Before diving into algorithms and mathematical calculations we must first stop and ask ourselves the essential question: <br>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <em> Why should I study Reinforcement Learning?</em> ðŸ¤”</p>

## Advances in Artificial Intelligence

- **June 2018**: OpenAI introduces the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), laying the foundation for subsequent LLMs.

- **February 2019**: OpenAI releases GPT-2, demonstrating significant improvements in text generation capabilities.

- **June 2020**: GPT-3 is unveiled, featuring 175 billion parameters and showcasing advanced language understanding and generation.

- **January 2021**: OpenAI announces DALL-E, a model capable of generating images from textual descriptions.

- **April 2022**: DALL-E 2 is introduced, offering enhanced image resolution and greater realism in generated images.

- **November 2022**: OpenAI releases ChatGPT, a conversational AI based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, enabling more interactive and contextually relevant dialogues.

At GWU, where minds aspire, <br>
Reinforcement learners never tire <br>
In search of policies, bold and bright, <br>
They train their agents, day and night. <br>
<br>
With Sutton, Barto as their guide, <br>
They walk the path, rewards beside. <br>
Exploring states with epsilon's grace, <br>
They find the optimal embrace. <br>
<br>
Gridworlds vast, mazes deep, <br>
In code they sow, in dreams they reap. <br>
The future's theirs, they push, they strive-- <br>
GWU's learners, alive, alive!

> In essence, the AI model's behavior <u>closely mirrors human-like actions</u>. This is expected, given its training on extensive datasets derived from human behavior. However, continued training on the same datasets will likely result in models that perform at a human-equivalent level. To achieve significant breakthroughs, we must explore learning methods that <u>transcend typical human capabilities</u>.

## The Goal of Reinforcement Learning

::: {.callout-tip}
## Emergent Behavior
Reinforcement Learning is concerned with seeking _emergent behavior_, or behavior that goes beyond what people might do or think of. <br>
:::

> Ultimately, as scientists, we want to discover new solutions for a task so that when an agent, or decision-maker, is placed in a novel situation it can respond intelligently.
