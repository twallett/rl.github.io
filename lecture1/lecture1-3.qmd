We know why it matters and what itâ€™s all about. Now, letâ€™s dive into:
<p style="text-align: center;"> <em> Where is Reinforcement Learning Applied?</em> ðŸ¤”</p> 
:::


## Recommendation Systems

Reinforcement Learning powers modern recommendation systems by dynamically adapting to user preferences, optimizing content suggestions in platforms like Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify using techniques such as Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB).

## Games

Reinforcement Learning has revolutionized gaming by enabling AI to master complex environments, from Atari classics to advanced strategy games, using deep learning techniques like Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to achieve superhuman performance.

## Robotics

In robotics, Reinforcement Learning enables autonomous agents to learn complex motor skills, such as dexterous manipulation and locomotion, through continuous interaction and training with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
