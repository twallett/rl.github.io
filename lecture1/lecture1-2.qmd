So now that we have answered the fundamental question of why. It's time for the next big mystery:
<p style="text-align: center;"> <em> What is Reinforcement Learning?</em> ðŸ¤”</p> 
:::

Good news! We can sum up the core idea of Reinforcement Learning in just one powerful sentence [@brunskill2022cs234]:

::: {style = "text-align:center;"}
# Learning Optimal Sequential Decision-Making Under Uncertainty 
:::

But what exactly does that mean? Letâ€™s break it down!

## Learning

At its core, learning in Reinforcement Learning occurs through trial and error, where an agent refines its actions based on _evaluative feedback_ from the environment. 

::: {.callout-tip}
## Evaluative Feedback
_Evaluative feedback_ indicates how good the action taken was, but not whether it was the best or the worst action. <br>

Unlike both supervised/unsupervised learning which rely on _instructive feedback_ through gradient based optimization. 

::: {.callout-tip}
## Instructive Feedback
_Instructive feedback_ indicates the correct action to take, independently of the action actually taken. <br>

For example, supervised/unsupervised learning focus on identifying what makes an image a cheetah by learning patterns from a dataset of animal images. In contrast, Reinforcement Learning is about teaching a cheetah how to run by interacting with its environment (Lecture 10).

## Optimal

The goal of Reinforcement Learning is to maximize rewards over time by finding the best possible strategy. This involves seeking:

- A Maximized discounted sum of rewards, or goal $G$.
- Optimal Value Functions $V^{*}$.
- Optimal Action-Value Functions $Q^{*}$.
- Optimal Policies $\pi^{*}$.
- A Balance between exploration vs. exploitation.

## Sequential Decision-Making

Unlike a one-time choice, Reinforcement Learning involves a chain of decisions where each action affects the next.

::: {.center style = "text-align:center;"}
![Markov Decision Process](images/MDP.png)
:::

::: {.center style = "text-align:center;"}
$\pi: S_{0}, A_{0}, R_{1}, S_{1}, A_{1}, R_{2}, ... , S_{T-1}, A_{T-1}, R_{T}$
:::

- Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a formal framework for modeling decision-making.
- The agent selects actions over multiple time steps, shaping its future states and rewards.
- Each decision affects not only immediate rewards but also the trajectory of future outcomes.
