## Challenges in Reinforcement Learning

- **Balancing Exploration vs Exploitation**

- **Sample Efficiency**

- **Sparse Rewards**

- **Converging to optimal policies**

## Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

- **Definition:** AGI is AI capable of learning and applying intelligence across a wide range of tasks, similar to human cognition.

- **Role of RL in AGI:** RL enables autonomous learning and decision-making, key for AGI's adaptability and problem-solving.

- **Current Progress:** Significant advancements in deep RL and multi-agent systems, though AGI remains a long-term goal.

- **Potential Impact:** AGI could revolutionize industries, solve global challenges, and transform work and society.
