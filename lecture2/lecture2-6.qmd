## Continuous Random Variable

A **continuous random variable** is a mapping $X$ of all the events of a sample space to numerical values $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
$$ 
X: Event \in Sample \ Space \to x \in \mathbb{R} 
$$

## Probability Density Function (PDF)

A **probability density function (PDF)** is a mapping of values $x$ of intervals of continuous random variables $X$ to probabilities $[0,1]$.

$$ 
P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_{a}^{b} f_{X}(x) \ dx 
$$

PDF has properties:
$$
f_{X}(x) \geq 0, \ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{X}(x) \ dx = 1
$$

## Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The **cumulative distribution function (CDF)** for continuous random variables is defined as:

$$ F_{X}(x) = P(X \leq x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} f_{X}(u) \ du $$

Relation to PDF:

$$
f_{X}(x) = \frac{dF_{X}(x)}{dx}
$$
$$
F_{X}(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} f_{X}(u) \ du
$$

## Expectation and Variance of PDFs

Continuous **expectation**, or mean, is the average numerical value that the continuous random variable takes over the PDF.
$$ 
E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \ f_{X}(x) dx 
$$

Continuous **variance** is the expected squared difference from the mean of a PDF.
$$ 
\text{Var}[X] = E[(X - E[X])^{2}] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x - E[X])^2 \ f_{X}(x) dx 
$$

## Joint and Marginal PDFs

The **joint PDF** calculates the intersection of two continuous random variables:
$$ 
P((X,Y) \in A) = \int \int_{A} f_{X,Y}(x_{1}, x_{2}) dx_{1} \ dx_{2} 
$$

From the previous definition we can also compute the **marginal PDF** for a particular random variable:

$$
f_{X}(x_{1}) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{X,Y}(x_{1}, x_{2}) dx_{2}
$$

$$
f_{Y}(x_{2}) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{X,Y}(x_{1},x_{2}) dx_{1}
$$

## Conditional Expectation of PDFs

The **conditional PDF** gives the probability distribution of a continuous random variable given that another variable has a specific value.
$$ 
f_{X|Y}(x_{1}| x_{2}) = \frac{f_{X,Y}(x_{1}, x_{2})}{f_{Y}(x_{2})} 
$$

The **conditional expectation** is the expected value of a continuous random variable given that another variable is fixed at a specific value.
$$ 
\mathbb{E}[X| Y = x_{2}] = \int_{x_{1} \in X} x_{1} \frac{f_{X,Y}(x_{1}, x_{2})}{f_{Y}(x_{2})} dx_{1} 
$$

## Independence

Two continuous random variables are **independent** if:
$$ 
f_{X,Y}(x_{1}, x_{2}) = f_{X}(x_{1}) f_{Y}(x_{2}) 
$$

This can be extended to multiple random variables:
$$ 
f_{X_{1},...,X{n}}(x_{1}, ..., x_{n}) = f_{X_{1}}(x_{1}) ... \ f_{X_{n}}(x_{n}) 
$$
