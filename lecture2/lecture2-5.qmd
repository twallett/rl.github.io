## Discrete Random Variable

A **discrete random variable** is a mapping $X$ of all of the outcomes of a sample space to numerical values $x \in \mathbb{Z}$.

$$
X: Outcome \in Sample \ Space \to x \in \mathbb{Z}
$$

## Probability Mass Function (PMF)

A **probability mass function (PMF)** is a mapping of values $x$ of discrete random variables $X$ to probabilities $[0,1]$.

$$
p_{X}(x) = P(X = x)
$$

PMF has properties:
$$
p_{X}(x) \geq 0, \quad \sum_{x} p_{X}(x) = 1
$$

## Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The **cumulative distribution function (CDF)** for discrete random variables is defined as:

$$
F_{X}(x) = P(X \leq x) = \sum_{k \leq x} p_{X}(k)
$$

Relation to PMF:
$$
p_{X}(x) = \frac{dF_{X}(x)}{dx}
$$

$$
F_{X}(x) = \sum_{k \leq x}p_{X}(k)
$$

## Expectation and Variance of PMFs

Discrete **expectation**, or mean, is the average numerical value that the discrete random variable takes over the PMF.
$$
E[X] = \sum_{x} x \ p_{X}(x)
$$

Discrete **variance** is the expected squared difference from the mean of a PMF.
$$
Var[X] = E[(X - E[X])^{2}] = \sum_{x}(x - E[X])^2 p_{X}(x)
$$

<!-- #### <u>Exercise</u>

What is the expectation $E[X]$ and variance $Var[X]$ of a single roll of a fair die?

## Solution

## Joint and Marginal PMFs

The **joint PMF** calculates the intersection of two discrete random variables:
$$
p_{X,Y}(x_{1},x_{2}) = P(X = x_{1}, Y = x_{2})
$$

From the previous definition we can also compute the **marginal PMF** for a particular random variable:
$$
p_{X}(x_{1}) = \sum_{x_{2}} p_{X,Y}(X = x_{1},Y = x_{2})
$$

## Conditional Expectation of PMFs

The **conditional PMF** gives the probability distribution of a discrete random variable given that another variable has a specific value.
$$
p_{X|Y}(x_{1}| x_{2}) = \frac{p_{X,Y}(x_{1}, x_{2})}{p_{Y}(x_{2})}
$$

The **conditional expectation** is the expected value of a discrete random variable given that another variable is fixed at a specific value.
$$
E[X| Y = x_{2}] = \sum_{x_{1}} x_{1} \frac{p_{X,Y}(x_{1}, x_{2})}{p_{Y}(x_{2})}
$$

## Independence

Two discrete random variables are **independent** if:

$$
p_{X,Y}(x_{1}, x_{2}) = p_{X}(x_{1}) p_{Y}(x_{2})
$$

For multiple discrete random variables:
$$
p_{X_{1},...,X_{n}}(x_{1}, ..., x_{n}) = p_{X_{1}}(x_{1}) ... \ p_{X_{n}}(x_{n})
$$
