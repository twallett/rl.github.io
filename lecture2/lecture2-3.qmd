A way to update probabilities when given new information, refining our understanding of how likely an event is. ðŸ¤”

## Conditional Probability

Suppose $A$ and $B$ are events. <br>
**Conditional probability** is the likelihood of an event occurring given that we know another event has occurred.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  ![](images/condprob.png){width=55%}
</div>

$$ 
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} 
$$

Intuition: conditioned event becomes the new sample space. <br>
If $P(B) \neq 0$, then the probability of the intersection normalized by the conditioned space. <br>
Else $P(B) = 0$, then $P(A|B)$ is undefined.

## Product Rule

Suppose $A$ and $B$ are events. <br>
The **product rule** states that the probability of two events $A$ and $B$ occurring together $A \cap B$ is given by the probability of one event occurring given the other $P(A|B)$ or $P(B|A)$ multiplied by the probability of the other event.
  
$$ 
P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) 
$$

## Total Probability Theorem

Suppose $A_{1,...,n}$ and $B$ are sets. <br>
The **total probability theorem** allows us to compute the likelihood of an event by summing over conditional probabilities of different partitions of the sample space.

$$ 
P(B) = P(B|A_1) P(A_1) + P(B|A_2) P(A_2) + P(B|A_3) P(A_3)
$$

<div style="text-align: center;">
  ![](images/totalcondprob){width=30%}
</div>

In general terms:

$$
P(B) = P(B|A_1) P(A_1) + ... + P(B|A_n) P(A_n)
$$

#### <u>Exercise</u>

**Experiment**: Classifying emails as spam $S$ or not spam $NS$ based on the word $W$ or not the word $NW$ "free".

$$
P(S) = 0.4
$$

$$
P(NS) = 0.6
$$

$$
P(W|S) = 0.7
$$

$$
P(W|NS) = 0.1
$$

Find the probability of $P(S|W)$:

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution

$$
P(S|W) = \frac{P(S \cap W)}{P(W)} = \underbrace{\frac{P(W|S)P(S)}{P(W|S)P(S) + P(W|NS)P(NS)}}_{Bayes' \ Theorem} = \frac{0.7 * 0.4}{0.7 * 0.4 + 0.1 * 0.6} = 0.82
$$
