## Methodology

Steps to perform a probabilistic model:

1. Specify sample space.
2. Define probability law (must align with probability axioms).
3. Identify event of interest.
4. Calculate...

## Sample Space

A **sample space** is a set of all possible outcomes from an experiment. <br>

$$
Sample \ Space = \{Heads, Tails\}
$$

An **experiment** is any procedure that can be repeated and has a well-defined set of outcomes. <br>

$$
Flipping \ a \ fair \ coin 
$$

An **outcome** is the end result of an experiment, or an element in the sample space.

$$
Heads  
$$

## Illustration: Discrete Sample Space

**Experiment:** Rolling two fair die at the same time.

$$ 
Sample \ Space = \{ (x, y) : x,y \in \mathbb{N}, 1 \leq x, y \leq 6  \} 
$$

## Illustration: Continuous Sample Space

**Experiment:** Measure two continuous variables in the range $[0,1]$

$$ Sample\ Space = \{ (x, y) : x,y \in \mathbb{R}, 0 \leq x, y \leq 1  \} $$

## Events and Experiment

An **event** is a subset of the sample space. <br>
Events are important because they ultimately get assigned probabilities.

**Experiment:** Rolling a die once.

$$ 
Sample \ Space = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}
$$


What is the event of rolling a $1$?

$$
\{1\} \subseteq \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}
$$

What is the event of rolling an odd number?

$$
\{1, 3, 5\} \subseteq \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}
$$

## Probability Axioms and Probability Law

Kolmogorov **probability axioms** are the foundations of axiomatic probability theory:

1. **Nonnegativity:** $P(Event) \geq 0$
2. **Normalization:** $P(Sample\ Space) = 1$
3. **Additivity:** If $A \cap B = \emptyset, P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$

**Probability laws** are additional axioms mathematically derived from Kolmogorov probability axioms.

#### <u>Exercise</u>

**Experiment**: Rolling two fair die at the same time.

Let all outcomes be equally likely.

$$ 
P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|Sample\ Space|}
$$

Find the following probabilities:

1. $P(die_1 = 1)$
2. $P(max(die_1, die_2) = 2)$

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution

1. $P(die_1 = 1) = \frac{6}{36} \approx 0.1\bar{6}$
2. $P(max(die_1, die_2) = 2) = \frac{2}{36} \approx 0.0\bar{5}$

#### <u>Exercise</u>

**Experiment**: Measure two continuous variables in the range $[0,1]$

$$ 
Sample\ Space = \{ (x, y) : x,y \in \mathbb{R}, 0 \leq x, y \leq 1  \} 
$$

Find the following probabilities:

1. $P(x = 0.5 , y = 0.5)$
2. $P(x+y \geq 1)$

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution

1. $P(x = 0.5 , y = 0.5) = 0$
2. $P(x+y \geq 1) = 0.5$
