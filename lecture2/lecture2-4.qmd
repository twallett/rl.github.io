::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon=false}
A property where two events do not influence each other, meaning the occurrence of one tells us nothing about the other. ðŸ”—

## Independent Events

Suppose $A$ and $B$ are two events. <br>
Two events are **independent** if the occurrence of event $B$ provides no information about the occurrence of event $A$:
  
$$ 
P(A|B) = P(A) 
$$  

Another definition of independence:
  
$$ 
P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B)
$$

For multiple events:

$$ 
P(A_{1} \cap A_{2} \cap ... A_{n}) = P(A_{1}) P(A_{2}) ... P(A_{n})
$$

## Conditioning and Independence

Suppose $A$, $B$, and $C$ are events. <br>
If $A$ and $B$ are independent, conditioning on $C$ may remove that independence. <br>
When we condition on $C$, events $A$ and $B$ may no longer be independent.

#### <u>Exercise</u>

The king comes from a family of two children. What is the probability that his sibling is female $F$ and not male $M$?

Let all outcomes be equally likely.

## Solution

$$
Sample \ Space = \{(FF), (FM), (MF), (MM)\} = \{(\not F \not F), (FM), (MF), (MM)\}
$$

$$
P(F|M) = \frac{P(F \cap M)}{M} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6\bar{6}
$$
