## Question 1
If the current state is $S_{t}$ and actions are selected according to stochastic policy $\pi$, then what is the expectation of $R_{t+1}$ in terms of $\pi$ and the four-argument function $p$?

## Question 2
Give an equation for $v_{\pi}$ in terms of $q_{\pi}$ and $\pi$.

## Question 3
Give an equation for $q_{\pi}$ in terms of $v_{\pi}$ and $\pi$.

## Coding Exercise 1: Markov Chain I
With a discount factor of $\gamma = 0.9$, calculate $v(t)$ when $t = 100$ for the following Markov Chain:
