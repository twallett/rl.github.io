## Question 1
Write some of the elements of the following sets:

1. $\{ 5x-1: x \in \mathbb{Z} \}$
2. $\{ x \in \mathbb{R}: \sin \pi x = 0 \}$
3. $\{X : X \subseteq \{3,2,a\} \text{ and } |X|=2 \}$

Write the following sets in set notation:

4. $\{ 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, ...\}$
5. $\{0,1,4,9,16,25,36, ...\}$
6. $\{..., \frac{1}{8},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{2},1,2,4,8,... \}$

## Question 2
A retail store accepts either American Express or VISA. The percentages of customers carrying each card are: <br> 

- American Express: $24%$
- VISA: $61%$
- Both: $11%$

What percentage of customers carry a card accepted by the store?

## Question 3
Sixty percent of students wear neither a ring nor a necklace. Given: <br>

- $20%$ wear a ring
- $30%$ wear a necklace

Find the probability that a randomly chosen student wears:

1. A ring or a necklace
2. Both a ring and a necklace

## Question 4
Two fair dice are rolled. Find the conditional probability that at least one die lands on $6$, given that they land on different numbers.

## Question 5
An urn contains $6$ white and $9$ black balls. If $4$ balls are selected without replacement, what is the probability that the first $2$ are white and the last $2$ are black?

## Question 6
A defendant is judged guilty if at least $2$ out of $3$ judges vote guilty. Given: 

- Probability of a guilty vote when defendant is guilty: $0.7$ <br>
- Probability of a guilty vote when defendant is innocent: $0.2$ <br>
- $70%$ of defendants are guilty

Compute the conditional probability that judge $3$ votes guilty given:

1. Judges $1$ and $2$ vote guilty. <br>
2. Judges $1$ and $2$ split votes. <br>
3. Judges $1$ and $2$ vote not guilty.

Are the judges' votes independent? Conditionally independent? Explain.

## Question 7
Given the distribution function of $X$:

$$
F_{X}(\lambda) = 
\begin{cases}
0, & \lambda < 0 \\
\frac{1}{2}, & 0 \leq \lambda < 1 \\
\frac{3}{5}, & 1 \leq \lambda < 2 \\
\frac{4}{5}, & 2 \leq \lambda < 3 \\
\frac{9}{10}, & 3 \leq \lambda < 3.5 \\
1, & \lambda \geq 3.5 \\
\end{cases}
$$


Find $p_X(\lambda)$.

## Question 8
A player rolls a fair die and flips a fair coin. If heads, they win twice the die value; if tails, they win half. Determine the expected winnings.

## Coding Exercise 1
The binomial distribution PMF is:

$$
p_X(\lambda) = {n \choose k} \lambda^n (1-\lambda)^{n-k}
$$

Using Python, generate binomial data and create visualizations for $p_X(\lambda)$ and $F_X(\lambda)$.
